Are you struggling with coming up with an idea for your start-up? Take Africa's lead.
<br><br>

As founders, we know that the most successful start-ups are those meeting the most pressing needs.
<br><br>
In Egypt, it's estimated as of 2022; the poverty rate was measured at 27.9 percent. During the same study, it was found 11.6 percent of Americans experience poverty. In countries with wildly different cultures and ideas of what success looks like - why is Egypt the birthplace of one of the most successful start-ups in history? Likewise with Nigeria and Kenya?
<br><br>
The constant outpour of new enterprises in a digitalized world makes it seem that every industry is over-saturated. So, you might be asking the question – How do you develop a unicorn business ideas that lead to explosive growth?
<br><br>
The answer could be found in exploring a few vital African start-ups, and the economies in which start-ups thrive.
<br><br>
Traditionally, the continent of Africa contained some of the most poverty-stricken nations in the world. But the winds of change are currently blowing! As we write this, <br>keywords like "Africa's start-up companies and African<br> start-up funding" are booming.
<br><br>
What are these founders doing right? And how can we<br> echo their approach in our business?
<br><br>
It all begins with two simple steps to create a flourishing<br> start-up business.
<br><br>
First, identify a problem. This could be<br> a problem you have, a problem you've solved in the past,<br> or a problem you've placed in various systems.
<br><br>
Second, solve it one of two ways:
<br><br>
1.) Solve an old problem for a new consumer<br>
2.) Solve a new problem for an old consumer.
<br><br>
To see option #1 in action, take a gander at the Egyptian start-up Paymob. Paymob shot to solve the same problem as many other point-of-sale systems. But, Paymob selected a new consumer! Paymob aimed to give start-up founders a cheap, easy-to-use, and mobile point-of-sale system for members of their community - people who did not feel more common western POS systems would serve them as their economy is much more unique than the traditional western economy we understand. Like many before, they created a way for users to make cash-free payments; they just did it for an underserved community.
<br><br>
To understand option #2, let's look at the Nigerian start-up Reliance Health. Having raised nearly $40 million US, Reliance Health removes consumers' need to visit the doctor's office. In the wake of The Pandemic, patients all over Nigeria turned their back to traditional in-office care for a more affordable and convenient option. In other words, Reliance Health solved a brand new problem for an existing population.
<br><br>
To sum it up, for every significant problem, there is an opportunity for extraordinary business success. Keep your eyes peeled for daily issues and complaints - one could be your next big idea. As one of our founders always says, 'stay negative.'
