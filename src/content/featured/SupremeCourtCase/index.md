What is section 230: Telecommunications Act of 1996?
</span>
<br/>
“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” (47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)).   
<br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:1000;font-size:20px">
So, let’s get Section 230 explained.
</span>
In theory, this is a positive law that promotes and protects free speech. It allows websites and social media platforms to not be liable for what their users post and protects their users by limiting what information these online platforms can sensor. In short, the Section 230 text wanted to promote space for unhindered dialogue between individuals without censorship from the venues where they hold their discussions.

What is being brought up in Section 230 reform? And is Section 230 bad?
</span>
<br/>

These are the four main points* of Section 230 that are “ripe” for reform:
<br/><br/>

<ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li>1. Incentivizing Online Platforms to Address Illicit Content</li>
    <li>2. Clarifying Federal Government Enforcement Capabilities to Address Unlawful Content</li>
    <li>3. Promoting Competition</li>
    <li>4. Promoting Open Discourse and Greater Transparency</li>
</ol>

These potential reformations seem rational, but the Supreme Court will hear two cases in the coming months, and their verdict could change everything. Both cases state that online platforms shouldn’t be punished for what their users post but should be held accountable for the information their algorithms promote. The alarming parts about a potential reform are: the judges making the calls most likely do not understand the implications of what their rulings might enact and the ripple-down effect these might cause to future internet users. If the Supreme Court rules that online platforms are responsible for what their users post it could cause irreversible harm to major platforms as well as potentially shut down the next generation of websites and apps. 

<br/>
    A list of pros and cons of Section 230 reform for founders:
<br/><br/>

<span style="text-align: left;">
    Pros–
</span>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>&bull; Limit commercial enterprises ability to invoke Section 230 to suppress competition - thus creating more opportunity</li>
    <li>&bull; Allow more action to remove or revoke purveyors of false or harmful information - which could keep those who would harm your business off your platforms</li>
    <li>&bull; Promote free and open communication between the platform and the user - which would create opportunity for quicker and easier improvement</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Cons–
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>&bull; Could potentially put platforms and apps liable for what their users post - meaning you could be held responsible for what your users do or say</li>
    <li>&bull; Could cause unforeseen trickle-down consequences for future internet users </li>
    <li>&bull; Could cause extreme censorship </li>
    <li>&bull; Could allow the Federal Government to use these platforms as a prosecution and censorship tool</li>
</ul>

    How should tech start-up companies prepare if the worst happens and tech giants like Google and Meta fall?
</span>
<br/>
In our opinion, preemptive action is the best course. Be in a growth mindset and don’t ignore the power of networking. Companies can see massive growth over a short period on social media. With change on the horizon, it is now more important than ever to harness the potential of online-based marketing, and this comes in two key forms. Non-asset-based marketing efforts are nurturing a community from a platform you don’t own, like social media. Asset-based marketing is when you nurture a community from a stage you own. If you properly utilize both efforts - you can grow your asset-based marketing venues even faster. Seize the opportunities that are currently available, for we can never predict exactly how changes to policies like Section 230 will influence future markets.

    Here are some steps
</span>
 to bolster your asset-based marketing:

<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>&bull; Create email lists</li>
    <li>&bull; Collect phone numbers</li>
    <li>&bull; Create event attendee lists</li>
    <li>&bull; Speak at events</li>
    <li>&bull; Host your own message boards</li>
</ul>
